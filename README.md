# extrInfo
This project enables the user to extract information of one person, so it does the same thing as the human can do. This project does not use the web crawling but the web scraping technique.

It was easy to create since it uses one model of python which is: "BeautifulSoup".

This project respects the user's privacy as well as the requirement in the LinkedIn website. I consent that this project will not influence at all the good functionnement of "linkedin.com". Also, a letter will be sent in order to require the possibility to scrap this website.

Steps to follow:
1. Put the link of the person in the research bar of the application, you will have the name, title and the city where the person live.
2. You can extract data in a .csv file.
